## ⚠️ **Essential Lab Information** 

<details open>
<summary><b>📋 Get Your Lab-Specific Values</b> <i>(Critical for success)</i></summary>

**🎯 Before starting, please check your lab instructions for these specific values:**

- 📨 **Topic name**: `gcloud-pubsub-topic` (pre-created in your lab)
- 📥 **Subscription name**: `pubsub-subscription-message` (you'll create this)
- 📸 **Snapshot name**: `pubsub-snapshot` (you'll create this)
- 🔗 **Pre-created subscription**: `gcloud-pubsub-subscription` (for snapshot task)
- 🌍 **Region**: (check your lab instructions - may vary)

**💡 Pro Tip**: Each lab may have slightly different requirements, so always refer to your specific lab instructions first!

## 🎯 **Challenge Lab Tasks - Step by Step Solution**

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Pre-Setup: Environment Preparation</b> <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>

### **Step 0: Activate Cloud Shell & Setup Environment**

1. **🚀 Open Cloud Shell** in your Google Cloud Console
2. **⚙️ Set up your environment variables:**

```bash
# Get your project ID
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
echo "🎯 Working in project: $PROJECT_ID"

# Enable the Pub/Sub API (if not already enabled)
gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com

# Verify API is enabled
gcloud services list --enabled --filter="name:pubsub.googleapis.com"
```

**💡 Pro Tip**: Always verify your project ID and ensure you're working in the correct project!

## 📤 **Task 1: Publish a Message to the Topic**

<details open>
<summary><b>🎯 Task 1 Breakdown</b> <i>(Your first challenge)</i></summary>

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. Create a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription named `pubsub-subscription-message`
2. Subscribe to the pre-created topic `gcloud-pubsub-topic`
3. Publish a "Hello World" message to the topic

### **🔍 Understanding the Concepts:**

**Topic**: Think of it as a message board where messages are posted
**Subscription**: Like a personal mailbox that receives copies of messages from a topic
**Message**: The actual data being sent through the system

</details>

### **Step 1.1: Verify the Pre-created Topic**

```bash
# Check if the topic exists
gcloud pubsub topics list --filter="name:gcloud-pubsub-topic"

# If the topic doesn't exist, create it (sometimes it takes time to provision)
gcloud pubsub topics create gcloud-pubsub-topic

echo "✅ Topic verified: gcloud-pubsub-topic"
```

### **Step 1.2: Create the Subscription**

```bash
# Create subscription named 'pubsub-subscription-message' for topic 'gcloud-pubsub-topic'
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create pubsub-subscription-message \
    --topic=gcloud-pubsub-topic

echo "✅ Subscription created: pubsub-subscription-message"

# Verify subscription was created
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list --filter="name:pubsub-subscription-message"
```

### **Step 1.3: Publish the "Hello World" Message**

```bash
# Publish the required "Hello World" message to the topic
gcloud pubsub topics publish gcloud-pubsub-topic \
    --message="Hello World"

echo "✅ Message 'Hello World' published to gcloud-pubsub-topic"

# Let's also publish a timestamped message for better tracking
gcloud pubsub topics publish gcloud-pubsub-topic \
    --message="Hello World from $(date)"
```

### **🎯 Task 1 Verification**

```bash
# Verify that the subscription exists and is properly configured
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe pubsub-subscription-message

echo "🎉 Task 1 completed successfully!"
```

---

## 👀 **Task 2: View the Message**

<details open>
<summary><b>🎯 Task 2 Breakdown</b> <i>(Verify your messaging)</i></summary>

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. Use the gcloud command to pull messages from your subscription
2. Pull up to 5 messages to verify message delivery
3. Confirm that Cloud Pub/Sub messaging is working correctly

### **🔍 Understanding Message Pulling:**

**Pull**: Actively requesting messages from a subscription
**Auto-ack**: Automatically acknowledging messages so they're marked as processed
**Limit**: Maximum number of messages to retrieve in one pull

</details>

### **Step 2.1: Pull Messages from the Subscription**

```bash
# Pull messages from the subscription (this is the exact command required by the lab)
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull pubsub-subscription-message --limit 5

echo "✅ Messages pulled from subscription (without auto-acknowledgment)"
```

### **Step 2.2: Alternative - Pull with Auto-Acknowledgment**

```bash
# If you want to actually consume the messages (mark them as processed)
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull pubsub-subscription-message --auto-ack --limit 5

echo "✅ Messages pulled and acknowledged"
```

### **Step 2.3: Understand the Output**

The output will show:
- **DATA**: The actual message content ("Hello World")
- **MESSAGE_ID**: Unique identifier for the message
- **ATTRIBUTES**: Any additional metadata
- **DELIVERY_ATTEMPT**: How many times delivery was attempted

### **🎯 Task 2 Verification**

```bash
# Check subscription metrics
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe pubsub-subscription-message

echo "🎉 Task 2 completed successfully! Messages verified."
```

## � **Task 3: Create a Pub/Sub Snapshot**

<details open>
<summary><b>🎯 Task 3 Breakdown</b> <i>(Message recovery setup)</i></summary>

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. Create a snapshot with ID `pubsub-snapshot`
2. Use the pre-created subscription `gcloud-pubsub-subscription`
3. Understand how snapshots work for message replay

### **🔍 Understanding Snapshots:**

**Snapshot**: A point-in-time capture of a subscription's acknowledgment state
**Use Case**: Allows you to "rewind" a subscription to replay messages
**Recovery**: Essential for disaster recovery and testing scenarios

</details>

### **Step 3.1: Verify the Pre-created Subscription**

```bash
# Check if the pre-created subscription exists
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list --filter="name:gcloud-pubsub-subscription"

# If it doesn't exist, we might need to create it
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create gcloud-pubsub-subscription \
    --topic=gcloud-pubsub-topic 2>/dev/null || echo "Subscription may already exist"

echo "✅ Pre-created subscription verified: gcloud-pubsub-subscription"
```

### **Step 3.2: Create the Snapshot**

```bash
# Create a snapshot named 'pubsub-snapshot' from the subscription 'gcloud-pubsub-subscription'
gcloud pubsub snapshots create pubsub-snapshot \
    --subscription=gcloud-pubsub-subscription

echo "✅ Snapshot created: pubsub-snapshot"
```

### **Step 3.3: Verify Snapshot Creation**

```bash
# List all snapshots to verify creation
gcloud pubsub snapshots list

# Get detailed information about our snapshot
gcloud pubsub snapshots describe pubsub-snapshot

echo "✅ Snapshot verified and ready for use"
```

### **🎯 Task 3 Verification**

```bash
# Optional: Demonstrate snapshot functionality
# (Don't run this unless you want to test snapshot seek functionality)
# gcloud pubsub subscriptions seek gcloud-pubsub-subscription --snapshot=pubsub-snapshot

echo "🎉 Task 3 completed successfully! Snapshot created for message replay."
```

## 🧹 **Clean Up Resources (Optional)**

<details>
<summary><b>🗑️ Clean Up After Lab Completion</b> <i>(Avoid unnecessary charges)</i></summary>

**⚠️ Only run these commands AFTER you've verified your lab completion!**

```bash
# Delete snapshots first (they depend on subscriptions)
gcloud pubsub snapshots delete pubsub-snapshot --quiet

# Delete subscriptions
gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete pubsub-subscription-message --quiet
gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete gcloud-pubsub-subscription --quiet

# Delete topics
gcloud pubsub topics delete gcloud-pubsub-topic --quiet

echo "🧹 All lab resources cleaned up!"
```

## 🎯 **Pro Tips for Pub/Sub Mastery**

1. **📝 Always verify resource names** - Copy exact names from lab instructions
2. **🔄 Check resource dependencies** - Topics before subscriptions, subscriptions before snapshots
3. **⏱️ Allow for propagation time** - Some operations take a few seconds
4. **🧪 Test incrementally** - Verify each step before moving to the next
5. **📚 Understand the concepts** - Don't just copy commands, understand what they do
