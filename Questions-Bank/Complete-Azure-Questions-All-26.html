<h2 id="question-1-azure-api-management---minimum-apis">Question 1:
Azure API Management - Minimum APIs</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Your company uses two applications that
publish the following APIs: - App1 publishes 30 APIs that reside on five
servers. - App2 publishes 40 APIs that reside on 10 servers.</p>
<p>You need to implement an Azure API Management solution. The solution
must provide full functionality for both applications.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of APIs that you must publish in Azure API
Management?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> 2, 15, 70, 450</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 70</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> You need to publish all APIs from both
applications to provide full functionality. The calculation is: App1 (30
APIs) + App2 (40 APIs) = 70 total APIs. The number of servers is
irrelevant to the API count in API Management.</p>
