# Azure Certification Questions and Answers

## Question 1: Azure API Management
**Question:** Your company uses two applications that publish the following APIs:
- App1 publishes 30 APIs that reside on five servers.
- App2 publishes 40 APIs that reside on 10 servers.

You need to implement an Azure API Management solution. The solution must provide full functionality for both applications.

What is the minimum number of APIs that you must publish in Azure API Management?

**Options:** 2, 15, 70, 450

**Correct Answer:** 70

**Explanation:** You need to publish all APIs from both applications to provide full functionality. The calculation is: App1 (30 APIs) + App2 (40 APIs) = 70 total APIs. The number of servers is irrelevant to the API count in API Management.

## Question 2: Azure Event Hubs Data Storage
**Question:** Your company has a production line that uses several hundred sensors. You are designing a solution that will ingest the sensor data by using Azure Event Hubs, and then use Azure Stream Analytics to analyze it for anomalies.

You need to recommend a location to store the data ingested by Azure Event Hubs. The solution must minimize the cost.

Which location should you recommend?

**Options:** Azure Blob storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Power BI, Azure SQL Database

**Correct Answer:** Azure Blob storage

**Explanation:** Azure Blob storage offers the lowest cost per GB for data storage, has native integration with Event Hubs through capture functionality, and supports storage tiers for further cost optimization.

## Question 3: Azure SQL Database Performance
**Question:** Your company is designing an application named App1 that will use data from Azure SQL Database. App1 will be accessed over the internet by many users.

You need to recommend a solution for improving the performance of dynamic SQL Database data retrieval by App1.

What should you include in the recommendation?

**Options:** a CDN profile, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure HPC cache, ExpressRoute

**Correct Answer:** Azure Cache for Redis

**Explanation:** Azure Cache for Redis is specifically designed to cache frequently accessed database query results, provides sub-millisecond response times, and handles dynamic SQL data with configurable expiration policies.

---

## Question 4: Azure Virtual Networks
**Question:** You are designing a virtual networking solution for an Azure subscription. You intend to deploy virtual machines across three availability zones in the East US and West US Azure regions.

You need to recommend the minimum number of virtual networks that must be created for the planned virtual networking solution.

What should recommend?

**Options:** 1, 2, 3, 6

**Correct Answer:** 2

**Explanation:** Virtual networks are regional resources and cannot span multiple regions. You need one VNet for East US and one for West US. Each VNet can span multiple availability zones within its region.

## Question 5: Azure Virtual WAN
**Question:** Your company has branch offices on five continents. All the offices are connected to the closest Azure region.

You need to recommend an Azure service that provides:
- Automated connectivity between the offices
- Central control over security aspects of the connectivity
- Uses the Microsoft backbone for inter-office connectivity

Which service should you recommend?

**Options:** Azure Private Link, Azure Virtual WAN, Azure VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute

**Correct Answer:** Azure Virtual WAN

**Explanation:** Azure Virtual WAN provides automated branch-to-branch connectivity, centralized management and security policies, and leverages Azure's global network backbone for optimized inter-office connectivity.

---

## Question 6: Firewall Traffic Inspection
**Question:** You are designing an application that will be deployed on Azure Virtual Machines. The deployment will consist of one virtual network and three subnets. All traffic between subnets will be inspected by a firewall appliance deployed on one of the subnets.

Which component should you include in the design to ensure traffic is inspected by the firewall appliance?

**Options:** Application security groups, Azure Virtual WAN, NAT gateways, User defined routes

**Correct Answer:** User defined routes

**Explanation:** User Defined Routes (UDRs) allow you to override Azure's default routing behavior and direct inter-subnet traffic through the firewall appliance as a next hop for inspection.

---

## Question 7: NAT Gateway for Outbound Connectivity
**Question:** You need to design network connectivity for a subnet in an Azure Virtual Network. The subnet will contain 30 virtual machines. The virtual machines will establish outbound connections to internet hosts by using the same a pool of four public IP addresses. Inbound connections to the virtual machines will be prevented.

What should include in the design?

**Options:** Azure Private Link, Azure Virtual WAN, NAT Gateway, User Defined Routes

**Correct Answer:** NAT Gateway

**Explanation:** NAT Gateway provides secure outbound internet access, supports multiple public IP addresses (up to 16), prevents inbound connections, and can handle traffic from multiple VMs using Source Network Address Translation.

---

## Question 8: Azure Synapse Analytics
**Question:** You are designing an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace that will perform near real-time analytics of operational data stored in a Cosmos DB database.

What component should you recommend?

**Options:** Synapse dedicated SQL pool, Synapse Link, Synapse Pipelines, Synapse Studio

**Correct Answer:** Synapse Link

**Explanation:** Synapse Link provides native Cosmos DB integration, enables near real-time analytics without ETL processes, and maintains an analytical store in columnar format for optimized analytics while not affecting operational performance.

---

## Question 9: Azure Data Factory
**Question:** You plan to use Azure Data Factory to implement data movement and integration. You need to combine multiple movement and integration activities.

Which component should you create?

**Options:** dataset, integration runtime, linked service, pipeline

**Correct Answer:** pipeline

**Explanation:** Pipelines are designed to group and orchestrate multiple data movement and transformation activities, providing workflow management, activity chaining, and control flow capabilities.

---

## Question 10: Apache Spark Migration
**Question:** You plan to migrate an on-premises Apache Spark deployment to a managed Apache Spark service in Azure.

To which Azure service can you migrate the on-premises deployment?

**Options:** Azure Analysis Services, Azure Data Explorer, Azure Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics

**Correct Answer:** Azure Databricks

**Explanation:** Azure Databricks is built on Apache Spark, provides a fully managed Spark environment, supports all Spark APIs, and is designed specifically for migrating existing Spark workloads to the cloud with minimal code changes.
