## Question 1: Azure API Management - Minimum APIs
**Question:** Your company uses two applications that publish the following APIs:
- App1 publishes 30 APIs that reside on five servers.
- App2 publishes 40 APIs that reside on 10 servers.

You need to implement an Azure API Management solution. The solution must provide full functionality for both applications.

What is the minimum number of APIs that you must publish in Azure API Management?

**Options:** 2, 15, 70, 450

**Correct Answer:** 70

**Explanation:** You need to publish all APIs from both applications to provide full functionality. The calculation is: App1 (30 APIs) + App2 (40 APIs) = 70 total APIs. The number of servers is irrelevant to the API count in API Management.
