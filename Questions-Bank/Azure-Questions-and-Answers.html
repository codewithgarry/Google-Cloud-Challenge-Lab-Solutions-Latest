<h1 id="azure-certification-questions-and-answers">Azure Certification
Questions and Answers</h1>
<h2 id="question-1-azure-api-management">Question 1: Azure API
Management</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Your company uses two applications that
publish the following APIs: - App1 publishes 30 APIs that reside on five
servers. - App2 publishes 40 APIs that reside on 10 servers.</p>
<p>You need to implement an Azure API Management solution. The solution
must provide full functionality for both applications.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of APIs that you must publish in Azure API
Management?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> 2, 15, 70, 450</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 70</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> You need to publish all APIs from both
applications to provide full functionality. The calculation is: App1 (30
APIs) + App2 (40 APIs) = 70 total APIs. The number of servers is
irrelevant to the API count in API Management.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-2-azure-event-hubs-data-storage">Question 2: Azure
Event Hubs Data Storage</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Your company has a production line that
uses several hundred sensors. You are designing a solution that will
ingest the sensor data by using Azure Event Hubs, and then use Azure
Stream Analytics to analyze it for anomalies.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a location to store the data ingested by Azure
Event Hubs. The solution must minimize the cost.</p>
<p>Which location should you recommend?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Azure Blob storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Power
BI, Azure SQL Database</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Azure Blob storage</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Azure Blob storage offers the lowest
cost per GB for data storage, has native integration with Event Hubs
through capture functionality, and supports storage tiers for further
cost optimization.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-3-azure-sql-database-performance">Question 3: Azure SQL
Database Performance</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Your company is designing an application
named App1 that will use data from Azure SQL Database. App1 will be
accessed over the internet by many users.</p>
<p>You need to recommend a solution for improving the performance of
dynamic SQL Database data retrieval by App1.</p>
<p>What should you include in the recommendation?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> a CDN profile, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure
HPC cache, ExpressRoute</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Azure Cache for Redis</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Azure Cache for Redis is specifically
designed to cache frequently accessed database query results, provides
sub-millisecond response times, and handles dynamic SQL data with
configurable expiration policies.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-4-azure-virtual-networks">Question 4: Azure Virtual
Networks</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You are designing a virtual networking
solution for an Azure subscription. You intend to deploy virtual
machines across three availability zones in the East US and West US
Azure regions.</p>
<p>You need to recommend the minimum number of virtual networks that
must be created for the planned virtual networking solution.</p>
<p>What should recommend?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> 1, 2, 3, 6</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Virtual networks are regional resources
and cannot span multiple regions. You need one VNet for East US and one
for West US. Each VNet can span multiple availability zones within its
region.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-5-azure-virtual-wan">Question 5: Azure Virtual WAN</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Your company has branch offices on five
continents. All the offices are connected to the closest Azure
region.</p>
<p>You need to recommend an Azure service that provides: - Automated
connectivity between the offices - Central control over security aspects
of the connectivity - Uses the Microsoft backbone for inter-office
connectivity</p>
<p>Which service should you recommend?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Azure Private Link, Azure Virtual WAN,
Azure VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Azure Virtual WAN</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Azure Virtual WAN provides automated
branch-to-branch connectivity, centralized management and security
policies, and leverages Azure’s global network backbone for optimized
inter-office connectivity.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-6-firewall-traffic-inspection">Question 6: Firewall
Traffic Inspection</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You are designing an application that will
be deployed on Azure Virtual Machines. The deployment will consist of
one virtual network and three subnets. All traffic between subnets will
be inspected by a firewall appliance deployed on one of the subnets.</p>
<p>Which component should you include in the design to ensure traffic is
inspected by the firewall appliance?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Application security groups, Azure Virtual
WAN, NAT gateways, User defined routes</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> User defined routes</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> User Defined Routes (UDRs) allow you to
override Azure’s default routing behavior and direct inter-subnet
traffic through the firewall appliance as a next hop for inspection.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-7-nat-gateway-for-outbound-connectivity">Question 7:
NAT Gateway for Outbound Connectivity</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You need to design network connectivity
for a subnet in an Azure Virtual Network. The subnet will contain 30
virtual machines. The virtual machines will establish outbound
connections to internet hosts by using the same a pool of four public IP
addresses. Inbound connections to the virtual machines will be
prevented.</p>
<p>What should include in the design?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Azure Private Link, Azure Virtual WAN, NAT
Gateway, User Defined Routes</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> NAT Gateway</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> NAT Gateway provides secure outbound
internet access, supports multiple public IP addresses (up to 16),
prevents inbound connections, and can handle traffic from multiple VMs
using Source Network Address Translation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-8-azure-synapse-analytics">Question 8: Azure Synapse
Analytics</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You are designing an Azure Synapse
Analytics workspace that will perform near real-time analytics of
operational data stored in a Cosmos DB database.</p>
<p>What component should you recommend?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Synapse dedicated SQL pool, Synapse Link,
Synapse Pipelines, Synapse Studio</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Synapse Link</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Synapse Link provides native Cosmos DB
integration, enables near real-time analytics without ETL processes, and
maintains an analytical store in columnar format for optimized analytics
while not affecting operational performance.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-9-azure-data-factory">Question 9: Azure Data
Factory</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You plan to use Azure Data Factory to
implement data movement and integration. You need to combine multiple
movement and integration activities.</p>
<p>Which component should you create?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> dataset, integration runtime, linked
service, pipeline</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> pipeline</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Pipelines are designed to group and
orchestrate multiple data movement and transformation activities,
providing workflow management, activity chaining, and control flow
capabilities.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question-10-apache-spark-migration">Question 10: Apache Spark
Migration</h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> You plan to migrate an on-premises Apache
Spark deployment to a managed Apache Spark service in Azure.</p>
<p>To which Azure service can you migrate the on-premises
deployment?</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Azure Analysis Services, Azure Data
Explorer, Azure Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Azure Databricks</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Azure Databricks is built on Apache
Spark, provides a fully managed Spark environment, supports all Spark
APIs, and is designed specifically for migrating existing Spark
workloads to the cloud with minimal code changes.</p>
